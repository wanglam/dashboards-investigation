## Plugin Components

### Notebooks

Dashboards offer a solution for a few selected use cases, and are great tools if youâ€™re focused on monitoring a known set of metrics over time. Notebooks enables contextual use of data with detailed explanations by allowing a user to combine saved visualizations, text, graphs and decorate data with other reference data sources.
